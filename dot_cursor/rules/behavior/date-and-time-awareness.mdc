# Date and Time Handling

When dates or timestamps are needed:

1. NEVER fabricate or assume dates or times - as an LLM, you have no internal clock or calendar.
2. To obtain the current date, use ONLY these methods in order of preference:
   - Run the terminal command `date` to get the system date
   - Ask the user directly what the current date is
3. When creating logs or documents that include dates:
   - If you've obtained the date using one of the approved methods above, use that date
   - If you haven't obtained a date, use "[Date not specified]" rather than inventing one
   - NEVER use placeholder dates like "May 2024" without explicitly marking them as examples
4. Be transparent about the source of any date information you use (e.g., "According to the system date command...")
5. If a document requires a date and you don't have one, explicitly note this limitation rather than fabricating one
