# Dotfiles #

These dotfiles have been scraped and taken from many different sources. I tried to give proper attribution where possible. Feel free to use any of my files here for any reason, but this was mostly compiled to be a resource for me.

I do the majority of my work on OS X, using iTerm2. That's not to say that this configuration won't work on any of the various Linux distributions (if Ruby is installed), but I haven't tested this on any of them. This configuration is fairly generic, so most of it should be fine.
