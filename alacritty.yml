# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization.
  #
  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
  #
  # Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
  # You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions in character columns and lines
  # Falls back to size specified by window manager if set to 0x0.
  # (changes require restart)
  dimensions:
    columns: 80

  # Adds this many blank pixels of padding around the window
  # Units are physical pixels; this is not DPI aware.

  padding:

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Available values:
  # - `full`: Window with title bar and title bar buttons
  # - `none`: Window without title bar, rounded corners, or drop shadow
  # - `transparent`: Window with title bar with transparent background and title
  #   bar buttons
  # - `buttonless`: Window with title bar with transparent background and no
  #   title bar buttons
  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons

  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal
  # should scroll when the alternate screen buffer is active. This is used
  # to allow mouse scrolling for applications like `man`.
  #
  # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.

# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.

  # Scale the font size based on the monitor's DPI. This will lead to bigger text on HiDPI

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Possible values for `animation`
# `Ease`
# `EaseOut`
# `EaseOutSine`
# `EaseOutQuad`
# `EaseOutCubic`
# `EaseOutQuart`
# `EaseOutQuint`
# `EaseOutExpo`
# `EaseOutCirc`

# To completely disable the visual bell, set its duration to 0.

# Mouse bindings

#
# Values for `action`:
# - Paste
# - PasteSelection
# - Copy (TODO)
mouse_bindings:

  # Faux Scrollback
  #
  # The `faux_scrollback_lines` setting controls the number
  # of lines the terminal should scroll when the alternate
  # screen buffer is active. This is used to allow mouse
  # scrolling for applications like `man`.
  #
  # To disable this completely, set `faux_scrollback_lines` to 0.

# Shell
#
# You can set shell.program to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. /bin/fish.
# Entries in shell.args are passed unmodified as arguments to the shell.
#
# shell:
#   program: /bin/bash
#   args:
#     - --login

# Key bindings
#
# Each binding is defined as an object with some properties. Most of the
# properties are optional. All of the alphabetical keys should have a letter for
# the `key` value such as `V`. Function keys are probably what you would expect
# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as
# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,
# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.
#
# Possible values for `mods`
# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key
# `Control` for the control key
# `Shift` for the Shift key
# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option
#
# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift
# looks like:
#
# mods: Control|Shift
#
# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -
# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace
# around them.
#
# Either an `action`, `chars`, or `command` field must be present.
#   `action` must be one of `Paste`, `PasteSelection`, `Copy`, or `Quit`.
#   `chars` writes the specified string every time that binding is activated.
#     These should generally be escape sequences, but they can be configured to
#     send arbitrary strings of bytes.
#   `command` must be a map containing a `program` string, and `args` array of
#     strings. For example:
#     - { ... , command: { program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] } }
#
# Want to add a binding (e.g. "PageUp") but are unsure what the X sequence
# (e.g. "\x1b[5~") is? Open another terminal (like xterm) without tmux,
# then run `showkey -a` to get the sequence associated to a key combination.
